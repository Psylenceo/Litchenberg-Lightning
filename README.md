# Litchenberg-Lightning
Wanted to light up a Lichtenberg figure I got several years back. This uses a 3d printed frame, an Arduino nano clone, a resistor, and a strip of ws8212 LEDs.

I attempted to use the RGB functionality to add hues and atmosphere to the flashes, but I never got the color randomization code to give good results before calling the code more or less finished. Which is why some flashes are pink,purple,red, orange, etc

!!!!!BE WARNED THE CODE HAS VERY LITTLE COMMENTING!!!!!!
